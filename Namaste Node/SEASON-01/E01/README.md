# EPISODE-01: Introduction to NodeJs

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting and command-line tools.

- Node.js is maintained by the **OpenJS Foundation**.
- It executes JavaScript code outside the web browser.
- JavaScript is the core language of the web, and with Node.js, you can run it anywhere, hence the phrase "**Run JS everywhere**."
- Node.js has an **event-driven architecture** and supports **asynchronous I/O (non-blocking I/O)**.
- Node.js was created by **Ryan Dahl** in 2009.
- Ryan initially used the **SpiderMonkey** engine but quickly switched to **V8**.
- **Joyent** hired Ryan to work on Node.js, funding his project and contributing significantly to its growth.
- Originally called **"web.js"**, it was renamed **"Node.js"** due to its broader scope beyond web servers.
- **Apache HTTP Server** was a blocking server, but Ryan's goal was to create a non-blocking server.
- A non-blocking server can handle multiple requests with fewer threads.
- In **2010**, **NPM** (Node Package Manager) was introduced, which significantly contributed to Node.js's success.
- Initially available on **macOS** and **Linux**, Node.js gained **Microsoft** platform support in **2011**.
- In **2012**, **Isaac Z. Schlueter**, the creator of NPM, took over Node.js maintenance.
- In **2014**, **Fedor Indutny** forked Node.js into **io.js**, causing controversy. The two were merged in **2015** to form the **Node.js Foundation**.
- In **2019**, the **JS Foundation** and **Node.js Foundation** merged to create the **OpenJS Foundation**, which now maintains Node.js.
